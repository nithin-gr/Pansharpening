# Multi-Patch Self-Attention Network for Pansharpening
This repository contains code for the paper "Pansformers: Transformer-Based Self-Attention Network for Pansharpening", submitted to the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.

In this paper, we present a novel architecture called 'Pansformers', inspired from Transformer Networks, for the problem of Pansharpening. We introduce a 'Multi-Patch Attention' mechanims which calculates channel-wise attention on non-overlapping smaller patches of the image to capture local-level details.

We evaluated our model on 2 datasets created from IKONOS and LANDSAT-8 imagery, provided access to us under the Third Party Missions by the European Space Agency, and by Space Applications Centre (SAC) of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), respectively.
